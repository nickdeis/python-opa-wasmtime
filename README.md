# Open Policy Agent WebAssembly SDK for Python

This is based off [opa-wasm](https://pypi.org/project/opa-wasm/), which uses wasmer, but this targets wasmtime. This allows you to use OPA WASM binaries in Python versions above 3.10, which is the cutoff for wasmer.

It also appears to run significantly faster due to some optimizations I made and some optimizations in python in general since 3.10.

# Getting Started

## Install the module

```
pip install opa-wasmtime
```

## Usage

There are only a couple of steps required to start evaluating the policy.

```python
# Import the module
from opa_wasmtime import OPAPolicy

# Load a policy by specifying its file path
policy = OPAPolicy('./policy.wasm')

# Optional: Set policy data
policy.set_data({"company_name": "ACME"})

# Evaluate the policy
input = {"user": "alice"}
result = policy.evaluate(input)
```

## Support Targets

This module has been tested on python 3.10 and above and wasmtime 27.0.2 and above.

## Writing the policy

See [https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/how-do-i-write-policies/](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/how-do-i-write-policies/)

## Compiling the policy

Either use the [Compile REST API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/rest-api/#compile-api) or `opa build` CLI tool.

For example, with OPA v0.20.5+:

```bash
opa build -t wasm -e 'example/allow' example.rego
```

Which compiles the `example.rego` policy file with the result set to
`data.example.allow`. The result will be an OPA bundle with the `policy.wasm`
binary included.

See `opa build --help` for more details.
